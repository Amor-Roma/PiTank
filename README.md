# PiTank
Web page to control an 8 outlet power strip connected to an aquarium.  The power strip is connected to a relay board that is controlled by the GPIO of a Raspberry Pi.  The Pi runs a web server hosting a page that controls the GPIO.  The page also displays a live video feed of the aquarium sent from a old android phone.  The video can also be hosted from the Pi.
